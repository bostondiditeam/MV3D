The LiDAR data pre-processing pipeline is contained in LidarPreprocess.c.

## To compile LidarPreprocess.c:
make

## To run SampleProgram.py:
python SampleProgram.py

## Comments:
After running make, a share object named LidarPreprocess.so will be created.
The shared object is called by the code in SampleProgram.py.
Change the filepath to LidarPreprocess.so in SampleProgram.py.
Change the filepath to the .bin Velodyne LiDAR files in LidarPreprocess.c.
